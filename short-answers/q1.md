# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
    Using `async`/`await` is like following a recipe step by step, making it easier to understand what's happening compared to using .then and .catch, which can feel like jumping around between different parts of the code.
